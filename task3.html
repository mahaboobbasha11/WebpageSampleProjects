   <h4>Dr. Reddy’s Foundation (DRF) was established in 1996 with a mission to educate 
    and skill young people, enabling them to fast-track their way toward better livelihood options.
     The foundation’s early programs focused on children’s education and skill development among young individuals from lower-income households1.

    Driven by the vision of Dr. K. Anji Reddy, a renowned scientist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, 
    DRF aimed to empower individuals by providing them with affordable quality education. The foundation 
    
    established a school and a vocational college to achieve this goal. Over the years, DRF’s interventions 
    have impacted the lives of over 2 million people</h4>
